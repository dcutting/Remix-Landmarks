!1 LandmarkList

The LandmarkList component fetches and displays a list of landmarks.

First set up some landmark data.

|populate landmark service   |
|id|name  |latitude|longitude|
|99|London|51.5    |0.1      |
|42|Paris |48.8    |2.3      |

Show the list when the component starts.

|script|show landmark list |
|ensure|shows list on start|

Display the landmarks in a list in the order provided by the service.

|Ordered query: landmark list rows|
|row text                         |
|LONDON (51.5, 0.1)               |
|PARIS (48.8, 2.3)                |

When the user selects a row from the list, the component tells its delegate the ID of the landmark in that row.

|select row           |
|row|delegate told ID?|
|1  |42               |
|0  |99               |
